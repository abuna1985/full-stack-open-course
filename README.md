## 2. Why I Made This Repo

Ahoy hoy! Thanks for visiting this repo. I decided to create a space where I can document my progress on the free [Full Stack Open Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). I recently started working as a WordPress Front-End Developer. I do a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But the more developers I talk to, the more I realize my views on full-stack development match the views of forward thinking developers in 2016 (when I first started learning web development). So I decided to jump back into learning modern front-end development from structured learning sources. I also decided to make 2 changes from my normal learning approach:

1. I will be documenting everything I write for this course. [You can see my detailed notes for each section here](./notes/README.md)
2. I will be participating in the [CodeBookClub Full Stack Open Study Group (You can join here)](https://madisonkanna.com/codebookclub/) scrum sessions where we hold each other accountable and can ask questions.

My true intention is for a place to store all the stuff I learn from this course as a reference for me. It also can be a resource for you as a learning developer.

## 3. Thank you to the following developers

I would really like to thank [Shawn @swyx Wang](https://www.swyx.io/) and [Eliot Sanford](https://techieeliot.com/) for showing that learning in public and sharing your learning journey can truly grow your career exponentially.
